             <p>Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security.</p>
             <p>The game quizzes located on this web application focuses specifically on human error within cyber security and how to prevent it. The main two categories that will be focused on related to human error in cyber security is <b>Phishing</b> and <b>Ransomware.</b></p><br>
             
             <h1>Human Error in Computer Security</h1>
             <p>When discussing human error in cyber security, human error means unintentional actions - or lack of action - by employees and users that cause, spread or allow a security breach to take place. There are two categories of human error that can occur: skill-based and decision-based errors.</p>
             
             <h2>Skill-based errors</h2>
             <p>Skill-based human error consists of slips and lapses: small mistakes that occur when performing familiar tasks and activities. In these scenarios, the end-user knows what the correct course of action is, but fails to do so due to a temporary lapse, mistake or negligence. These might happen because the employee is tired, not paying attention, is distracted, or otherwise has a brief lapse of memory.<p>
             
             <h2>Decision-based errors</h2>
             <p>Decision-based errors are when a user makes a faulty decision. There can be a number of different factors that play into this: often it includes the user not having the necessary level of knowledge, not having enough information about the specific circumstance, or not even realising that they are making a decision through their inaction.<p>

             <h1>Phishing</h1>
             <p>Phishing is a form of social engineering attack that coerces users into accidentally downloading malware or giving over sensitive and personal information. Some attacks can be highly sophisticated, but the below image can help identify signs of a phishing email.</p>

             <br>
             
             <h1>Ransomware</h1>
             <p>Ransomware is a type of malware (malicious software) that cybercriminals use to hold people to ransom. A ransomware attack is where an individual or organization is targeted with ransomware. It can be spread to computers through attachments or links in phishing emails, by infected web sites by means of a drive-by download or via infected USB sticks. Once a computer or network is infected with ransomware, the malware blocks access to the system, or encrypts the data on that system. Cybercriminals demand that the victims pay a ransom in order to regain access to their computer or data. There are two main types of ransomware: crypto ransomware and locker ransomware.</p>
             
             <h2>Crypto ransomware</h2>
             <p>Crypto ransomware encrypts valuable files on a computer so that the user cannot access them. Cyberthieves that conduct crypto ransomware attacks make money by demanding that victims pay a ransom to get their files back.</p>
             
             <h2>Locker ransomware</h2>
             <p>Locker ransomware does not encrypt files. Rather, it locks the victim out of their device, preventing them from using it. Once they are locked out, cybercriminals carrying out locker ransomware attacks will demand a ransom to unlock the device.</p>
